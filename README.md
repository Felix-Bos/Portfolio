# Personal Portfolio with Integrated RAG Assistant

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to present my work, background, and technical skills. Unlike a traditional static portfolio, this platform includes an intelligent conversational component powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
The assistant is trained on my resume, projects, and technical documents, allowing it to answer questions as if I were responding in person.
